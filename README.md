What did Amsterdam look like in your year of choice?

This Adamlink Lab application queries for the buildings that existed in a particular year. It wil also name the building as it was known in that year (when we have that data, of course).

Being a lab application, it's rather quick & dirty. It's a php / js application, should run on any php server.
